TODO

Client and Server side check to delete old carpools.  When joining a carpool check to see if the carpool is expired and display error to user and clear from DB 

On server side check save valid data on form. On client-side check data saves, but on server side catch all formed data is cleared.(login,sign-up, add carpool date check) 

When to expire reoccurring carpools

Carpool temporary do not show days. Temporary orginally was meant to just be one day? Switched to temporary carpool for one week duration and needs to show days.
Add type column and seperate days of the week to new column on template

Change check expiration function to only flash to the user if they tried to join an expired carpool which was deleted, but not when the function executes.

check expiration needs to consult times to expire as well

WORK ON Check expiration times and test it against times
work on only triggering flash when actively trying to join expired carpool not if the function is running
If time also fix template to show carpools temporary and show the days selected make two columns for type and days
Make decision how reoccuring carpools will expire or not.
